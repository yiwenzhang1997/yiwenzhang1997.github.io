This is my first blog. Just wanted to say hi to everybody~

I built this platform for sharing my story and thoughts. I'm a grad student/greedy learner/foodie

Some fun facts about me:
* Besides psychology research, I'm also passionate about data science and statistics. I'm currently taking cousera courses on deep learning and enjoy it so much!
* I love watching book haul and vlogs on bilibili and youtube
* I'm currently reading Neapolitan Novels by Elena Ferrante and just finished The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry by Gabrielle Zevin
* I prefer coffee over boba tea
