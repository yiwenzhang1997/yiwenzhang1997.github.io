    <p class="main-text">Hi there, I'm Yiwen! <br> I'm a 2nd year phd student in cognitive psychology, 
        working with <a href="http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/rottman/">Dr. Ben Rottman</a> at 
        <a href="http://www.psychology.pitt.edu/">Univeristy of Pittsburgh</a>. 
        I'm also passionate in Data Science and Statistics.</p>
        Before that, I received my B.S in Psychology from Chu Kochen Honors College, <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a>.
    <br>My research interest centers around human causal learning and causal inference. 
        I'm also passionate in Data Science and Statistics.
    <br>Outside the lab, I enjoy leisure reading, cooking and painting!</p>

    <p class="main-text"><b>Causal learning with delays in 16 days</b>
        <br>
        One of research project I'm currently doing is to investigate how delays between cause and effect will affect causal learning. 
        An important question in the field of causal learning is whether people can learn causal relations when there are delays between
         causes and effects (e.g., Buehner & McGregor, 2006). However, previous studies have only investigated delays on the order of
          seconds. In this study we attempted to test whether people can learn a cause-effect relation with hour long delays,
           similar to how someone might test how quickly a medicine works by taking the medicine on certain days. The delays between
            the cause and effect were either  0, 3, 9, or 21 hours, and the study lasted 16 days.

    <p class="main-text"><b>Remote Psychology Task Experiment</b>
        <br>
        Most of my experiments are conducted outside lab. We developed web-based or mobile phone-based platform, allowing people to
        participate in the research remotely. Also, our lab built <a href="https://www.psychcloud.org/">psychCloud template</a> to share
         with psychology community how we conduct
         remote experiment. Currently I'm working on updating this template to most up-to-date stack using Flask, Vuejs and Firestore.
